Two datasets are available: temporal.txt and spectral.txt.
The temporal.txt dataset contains the time domain signals (5001 samples for each signal.).
The spectral.txt dataset contains the same signals as temporal.txt but in the 
frequency domain (2500 samples for each signal).
There are 27 signals representing 2 classes: 14 signals of herbicide and 13 
signals of water.
The temporal signals are in a matrix with dimensions 27x5001.
The spectral signals are in a matrix with dimensions 27x2500.
